## Question 1

| Run    | 1st run | 2nd run | 3rd run | 4th run | 5th run |
| ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Quanta | 1/1     | 2/2     | 4/4     | 8/8     | 15/16   |
| Sum    | 1       | 3       | 7       | 15      | 30      |

## Question 2

We know the formula _E3 = T/8 + T1/8 + T2/4 + T3/2_

A: 50/8 + 150/8 + 300/4 + 85/2 = 142,5 \
B: 300/8 + 150/8 + 85/4 + 50/2 = 102,5

Process B will be first because it needs less time.

## Question 3

CPU Bound means the rate at which process progresses is limited by the speed of the CPU.

I/O Bound means the rate at which a process progresses is limited by the speed of the User Input.

It is very important for the scheduler to distinguish between CPU-bound and I/O-bound. I/O bound processes dont need the cpu long but as fast as possible, because as example if the pilot of a plane wants to fly right, the process don't react and the plane is waiting for the "fly-right-process" as example 20 minutes, as long the process before needs, this could have massive consequences.

## Question 4

We know the formula _∑Ci/Pi ≤ 1_

35/50 + 20/100 + 10/200 + x/250 ≤ 1 =
0,95 + x/250 ≤ 1 =
x ≤ 12,5

so the largest value for x can be 12,5.
